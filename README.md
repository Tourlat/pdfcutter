## Motivation

This project was created to provide a simple and efficient way to manipulate PDF files from the command line. I wanted to stop using online tools for simple tasks like merging or deleting pages from PDFs. With this tool, users can easily manage their PDF documents without relying on third-party services and keep their files private.
